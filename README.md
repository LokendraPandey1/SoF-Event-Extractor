# SoF Event Extractor â€“ Laytime Intelligence  

An AI-powered tool that automates **Statement of Facts (SoF)** event extraction and **laytime calculation** for the maritime industry.  

---

## Problem  
Manual laytime calculation from SoF documents is **slow, error-prone, and leads to costly disputes** between shipowners and charterers.  

---

## Solution  
Our system:  
- Extracts key events (Arrival, NOR, Loading/Discharge, Delays).  
- Calculates laytime automatically.  
- Generates a **Laytime Statement** & **Visualization Dashboard**.  
- Exports results as PDF/Excel.  

---

## Demo Flow  
1. Upload SoF document.  
2. AI extracts timestamps & events.  
3. Engine computes laytime & financials.  
4. Dashboard + downloadable report.  

---

## Tech Stack  
- **Frontend:** React.js + TailwindCSS  
- **Backend:** Python (FastAPI)  
- **NLP/AI:** spaCy + Rule-based Parsing  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL  
- **Visualization:** Plotly / D3.js  

---

## Impact  
- Cuts manual effort by ~80%  
- Reduces disputes & financial loss  
- Boosts trust & transparency
