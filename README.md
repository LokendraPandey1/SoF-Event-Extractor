# SoF Event Extractor â€“ Laytime Intelligence  

An AI-powered tool that automates **Statement of Facts (SoF)** event extraction and **laytime calculation** for the maritime industry.

## Problem  
Manual laytime calculation from SoF documents is **slow, error-prone, and leads to costly disputes** between shipowners and charterers.

- Extracts key events (Arrival, NOR, Loading/Discharge, Delays).  
- Calculates laytime automatically.  
- Generates a **Laytime Statement** & **Visualization Dashboard**.  
- Exports results as PDF/Excel.

## Demo Flow  
1. Upload SoF document.  
2. AI extracts timestamps & events.  
3. Engine computes laytime & financials.  
4. Dashboard + downloadable report.
